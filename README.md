# Problem Statement:
The current landscape of e-commerce lacks an efficient and engaging way to reward customers and facilitate decision-making. Traditional loyalty programs are often complex and unengaging, leading to disconnection between customers and businesses. Additionally, managing these loyalty programs can be challenging for brands, and scalability is a concern. There's a need for a solution that revolutionizes the e-commerce experience, making it more rewarding and engaging for users and easier to manage for brands.
